# reactdit

Reddit-like app built with React+Redux (ES5). Reactdit is just a presentational layer, and it depends on [reactdit-api](/reactdit-api) for its backend operations. 

**Dislaimer!**: this application is not production-ready, nor was it created to actually compete with reddit. It it just a personal project intended for learning purposes.
